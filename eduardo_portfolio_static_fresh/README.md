Open `index.html` in a browser or with VS Code Live Server.

## Replace placeholders
- Put your real PDF at `assets/resume.pdf` (overwriting the placeholder).
- Replace images in `assets/images/` with your real assets (filenames kept the same),
  or update paths used in `script.js`.

## Add more slides
In `script.js`, extend the `galleries` object for each project key.
